 * @brief Thin wrapper driver that controls both Relay and Display MCP23017 chips together.
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-08-25
 *
 * This driver provides convenience functions to operate on both
 * the Relay MCP23017 and the Display MCP23017 simultaneously.
 * It reuses the robust, shadow-latched single-chip drivers internally.
