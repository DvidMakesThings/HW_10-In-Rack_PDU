- DONE - Implement high priority current monitor. Total current per outlet shall not be more than 10A EU / 15A US, minus 0.25A safety treshold.
- Correct the calibration process. Current offsets shall be calculated first and then adjusting CF value. Better: CF shall be calculated based on datasheet, so it's dependent on the real shunt resistor value. Automated process shall be implemented -> Test Failing with 6x 40W load due to measurement inaccuracy
- Sometimes rapid SNMP trafic starves the watchdog by not letting ButtonTask to yield. Need fix. Only experienced this during stress test -> need bugfix
